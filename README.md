# Restify Skeleton

This is a skeleton project which can act as a template for other projects
which wish to use a base application within Restify.

## Architecture

This is a Restify application with a few pieces of standardised middleware,
such as input and output loggers, which track correlation ids and response
codes, a centralised logger, and a few basic error handling areas.
